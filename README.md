# Hello there! Glad by your visit

Unfortunally I have to say that after 2023/july **there won't be any more <ins>personal projects</ins> on this profile**  
After [Microsoft adquiring GitHub](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github) and admiting using all [code hosted on their platform to feed its IA (Copilot)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22561180/github-copilot-legal-copyright-fair-use-public-code), hurting not only free software licenses and softwares but also all their Github own users  

This profile instead will only contains **contributions to professional and other open source projects**  

### To access my personal projects, see my gitlab instead:
